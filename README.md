# onestone portfolio

my onestone portfolio. this will be deprecating lordbagel42/livinginbeta and for the foreseeable future deprecating lordbagel42/portfolio. when I graduate, this will be used as a template for a dev portfolio.

i might also add a small feature that lets me send someone a link that changes the rendered site with a cookie. in theory, I can show either a one stone page or a developer portfolio page, on the same site and routes. just requires... a lot of weird logic.
