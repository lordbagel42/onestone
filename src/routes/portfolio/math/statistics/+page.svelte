			Honestly, I struggled a lot in my stats workshop. I didn't remember when I chose the workshop,
			but I've actually taken a stats class before, it was just called research and went over a lot
			more than just stats. I found the workshop to be made of entirely known content.

			I did make a custom chrome extension to track peoples typing speed for a study I conducted,
			but it honestly wasn't that hard and the study had nothing interesting or anything new come
			from it.

			In summary, I don't think I learned or grew because of this workshop. There was nothing new
			and the method it was taught in was incredibly confusing and time-consuming. I really
			struggled to stay on task in the workshop and actually doing the math I was assigned. I don't
			think this is really a fault of the coach running it, none of the math workshops this year
			have actually been at my level or taught by people who know how to teach math (except Josie's,
			but she left and I already knew her content.)
