		<ArticleParagraph>
			Robotics has been a large part of my education for quite a while. Since I was a kid in
			elementary school I wanted a job doing something with robots. I wasn't sure what, but just
			something. When I went to MATH SCHOOL, I ended up joining the First Robotics Competition team
			2122, Team Tators.

			Part of why I ended up joining SCHOOL was talking to COACH about their First Robotics
			Competition team, Quackers. During Disruption Night, she told me that she really wanted to
			have another person who was able to mentor it and I really wanted to help with that.

			On 2122, I have a bit less of a visible role. I develop our scouting software, something
			integral to our winning at competitions but not something that many people work on (read: it's
			just me and a mentor). I try and help out with the mechanical team when I can, but our meeting
			times conflict pretty often.

			Tators is a very high stakes and high performance team. I don't really get the ability to be
			making mistakes. On Quackers, I get to teach other SCHOOL students, my friends, how to make a
			good robot and how to use the tools available to us to their full potential.

			I don't get to really dig my fingers into the robot or the code with Quackers much, but I do
			it more than I do on Tators and I can watch people get the realization of "wait, I can code
			now?", and that's pretty cool.
