		I got up to a lot of shenanigans this year! I would much rather just talk about them than try
		and reflect on them beforehand. I didn't take a whole lot of photos and this page is honestly
		pretty boring without photos. I did not plan clicking this button into my presentation, so
		you're only seeing this if you either are looking at my website on your own, or if you asked me
		to click thisâ€”in which case, hello! Ask questions!
